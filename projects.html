                This is a project that I began just prior to the 2022 Fall semester to help with eye strain using Python. A well known rule is that for every
                20  minutes of screen time, there should be a 20 second break to look at a target that is at least 20 feet away which helps lower eye
                fatigue. The easy solution would be to simply create a program which utlizes a timer and a pop-up window to notify the user to take
                a break. However, this is not good for work flow as most people tend to get up, stretch, walk around and use the bathroom every now
                and then which fulfills the 20-20-20 rule. As a result, implementing this rule all the time is inefficient. This program uses OpenCV
                to detect when the user is directly looking at the screen for 20 consecutive minutes. If the person is not looking at the screen, or
                is away from the computer for a set amount of time, the streak is broken. The image above shows the facial detection when I cover
                the screen with my finger. The window on the left shows a GUI made using Tkinter.I plan on reformatting this project with more 
                functions to make it more modular and clean. I have yet to implement the timers. Furthurmore, I intend to use this as a work log to
                track my working habits. <a href = "https://github.com/PKC42/20-20-20-Project.git">Click here to see the code repository.</a>

            <p style = "font-size: 25px">
                SecureDrop was a project that was conducted during the Introduction to Computer Security course which I took in Fall 2022. My team 
                consisted of 3 people (myself included). In this project, we designed a secure file transfer system using concepts we learned in class.
                To do this, we hid passwords using password hashes and generated certificates and a certificate authority using EasyRSA. These certificates
                along with the certifcate authority would be used to verify clients while also encrypting and transfering files using TCP and an SSL wrapper.
                Ultimately, we were unsucessful in fully completing the program. This was due to our testing and development system which consisted of 
                4 separate docker containers with a specific port exposed to simulate individual clients. We were unable to successfully create a TCP connection
                with SSL wrappers using the generated certificates between these containers. The above shows user shows user registration and client addition
                which utilizes json files as a database along with password hashing and regular expressions to ensure that the names, emails and passwords
                are properly formatted and are of proper length. <a href = "https://github.com/PKC42/SecureDrop.git">Click here to see the code repository.</a>

            <p style = "font-size: 25px">
                This project was conducted over the course of 2 semesters is a group of 4. The objective was to create a spoon that can help disabled individuals
                pace themselves while eating to prevent choking with the goal of increasing independence for disabled individuals. In order to fulfil this,
                a spoon was designed using CAD, 3D printed using clear plastic and mounted on a metal spoon. A printed circuit board (PCB) was designed to
                control several LEDs and an accelerometer to make the spoon glow to notify the user to either put down the spoon, chew or take another bite.
                A full PDF of the Final Report can be found below with the design specifications and outcomes.

                This was a project that was completed in the Computing IV course at UMass Lowell. It involves using physics formulas, mass, acceleration
                and velocity to create an animation using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) in C++. This project utilized a celestial body 
                class and a universe class with the universe class inheriting from the celestial bodies class. The celestial bodies class contained information
                on each celestial body ranging from mass, acceleration, velocity and .gif file while the universe class stored each celestial body using a 
                vector and smart pointers. The result of the animation can be seen in the clip above. <a href = "https://github.com/PKC42/N-Body-Simulation.git">Click here to see the code repository.</a>

                This was a fun project which was completed during the Computing IV course at Umass Lowell. This project was written in C++ and utilized
                the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). The goal of this project was to use a simulated Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to change 
                the pixels of an image given a seed value. By using this seed value, the encrypted image can also be decrypted. The encrytion input and result

                This was another quick and fun project that utilized the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) and recursion to draw triangles using recursion.
                It should be noted that the length of each of the triangles sides get cut in half per each recursive cycle. An example with a depth of recursion of 4 can be seen above.

            <p style = "font-size: 25px">
                 Evil Hangman was a semester long project written in C conducted in Computing II Lab at UMass Lowell. In this project, a version of Hangman
                 was created that would make it nearly impossible for the player to guess the correct word. This is done by switching words as the user
                 makes a guess. This would be accomplished by organizing key combinations into key families. As the user makes a guess, the largest key
                 family would be selected giving the game a wider range of words to switch to thus thwarting the player. These keys were organized
                 using a binary search tree. This project was an incredibly educational experience as it was a good precurser to Computing III and Computing IV 
                 which involves object oriented programming. This project utlizes opaque objects and requires the user to essentially implement a vector in C 
                 using memory allocation functions. Furthurmore, I learned to use gdb and valgrind to diagnose memory leaks and segmentation faults.
