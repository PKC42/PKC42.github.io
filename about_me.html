            <p style = "font-size: 40px; text-align: justify">Hi! My name is Pratush Kc. I am a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts Lowell with a degree in 
                Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. My first introduction to coding occured when I started school at 
                Minuteman Regional Vocational High School located in Lexington, Massachusetts. Here, I programmed robots, microcontrollers, PLCs and other
                mechanical systems. From there, I went to UMass Lowell where I entered in initially as a Mechanical Engineering Major. I later switched to 
                Electrical Engineering. Upon taking my first formal programming course (Application Programming in C), I decided to minor in Computer Science
                which eventually turned into a second major due to interest. From my coursework, I have learned to appreciate the process of problem solving
                which I hope to implement in industry.
